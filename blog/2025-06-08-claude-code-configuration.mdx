I spent a lot of time writing and tweaking my prompts, so I'm sharing what works for me.

This is my complete Claude Code setup, broken down into three posts:

**üìã [Claude Code: Configuration That Works](/blog/claude-code-configuration)**

- Global `CLAUDE.md`
- Code style, commit message, and conversation guidelines

**üîÑ [Claude Code: The Perfect Development Loop](/blog/claude-code-workflow-commands)**

My core development loop using custom commands:
- `/user:todo` - Implement a task from a checklist
- `/user:commit` - `git commit` with a nice message
- `/compact` - Manage the context window

**üõ†Ô∏è [Claude Code: Custom Slash Commands](/blog/claude-code-utility-commands)**

Commands for code maintenance:
- `/user:comments` - Clean up comments in recent changes
- `/user:all-comments` - Clean up comments project-wide
- `/user:emoji` - Add emoji to content
- `/user:learn` - Add to Claude memory
- `/user:rebase` - Resolve merge conflicts
