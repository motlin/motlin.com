I worked hard on these prompts and think they're effective. This post covers how I configure `claude` using `CLAUDE.md` files and `settings.json` to control the behavior of the Claude code CLI.

This post is part of my [Claude Code setup series](/blog/claude-code-setup).

## Global CLAUDE.md

The global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` file sets default behavior for `claude` across all projects. [Mine](https://github.com/motlin/claude-code-prompts/blob/main/CLAUDE.md) is set up as imports of all the snippets below.

## Instructions for Humans

### Code Style

I start with code style instructions that are applicable to LLMs and human developers.

  {CodeStyleSource}
</CodeBlock>

## Instructions specific to LLMs

### Testing Practices

When writing tests, LLMs remind me of [Mr. Meeseeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Meeseeks). The LLM will go to any length to get tests to pass, including deleting all of the assertions.

The advice here is applicable to human developers too, but we're getting into LLM quirks now.

### Rhetorical questions?

Sometimes I ask `claude` why it implemented a feature one way and not another and it answers "You're right! I'll implement it \<the other way\>." Infuriating!

GPT-4o had [a now-famous bug](https://openai.com/index/sycophancy-in-gpt-4o/) that made it "overly supportive but disingenuous." It's "fixed," but all models can [trend toward sycophancy](https://www.anthropic.com/research/towards-understanding-sycophancy-in-language-models).

Tackling these these together:

### Long-lived processes

`claude` handles console output from linters and compiler well. But sometimes it will try to run a long-lived command like `npm run start` and basically hang.

<CodeBlock language="markdown" title=".claude-prompts/instructions/build-commands.md">
  {BuildCommandsSource}
</CodeBlock>

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/motlin/claude-code-prompts/blob/main/instructions/build-commands.md)

Sometimes Claude still tries to run long-lived commands so I've started to explicitly deny them.

<CodeBlock language="json" title="src/.claude-prompts/settings.json (deny section)">
  {SettingsDenyString}
</CodeBlock>

### Extra context just for you

`claude` can search the internet, and can read files from outside the current git repository, but it's an extra hop. I find it convenient to gather files into a subdirectory just for the LLM.

<CodeBlock language="markdown" title=".claude-prompts/instructions/llm-context.md">
  {LlmContextSource}
</CodeBlock>

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/motlin/claude-code-prompts/blob/main/instructions/llm-context.md)

These instructions work well. Though I'm deliberate about telling the LLM to look in `.llm/`.

### // Too Many Comments

LLMs write obvious comments.

```typescript
// Calculate elapsed time
const elapsedTimeMs = Date.now() - startTime
```

Here are my instructions telling Claude not to, but it really, really likes writing comments. The built-in system prompt flat out says "Do not add comments to the code you write" and that doesn't work either.

<CodeBlock language="markdown" title=".claude-prompts/instructions/llm-code-style.md">
  {LlmCodeStyleSource}
</CodeBlock>

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/motlin/claude-code-prompts/blob/main/instructions/llm-code-style.md)

I've come to accept that comments are crucial to how LLMs "think" and I cannot stop the LLM from writing them, at least in the first draft. My [comment cleanup commands](/blog/claude-code-utility-commands#comments) are great at getting rid of them in a second step.

### Claude's Commit messages

Claude code's commit messages are remarkably consistent, to the point where you know what [the system prompt](https://gist.github.com/transitive-bullshit/487c9cb52c75a9701d312334ed53b20c#file-claude-code-prompts-js-L448-L462) is going to say before you read it.

The system prompt includes [inconsistent and incorrect information](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/1000) about pre-commit hooks and staging changes, so I give my own corrections.

<CodeBlock language="markdown" title=".claude-prompts/instructions/llm-git-commits.md">
  {LlmGitCommitsSource}
</CodeBlock>

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/motlin/claude-code-prompts/blob/main/instructions/llm-git-commits.md)

I didn't expect this to work since it contradicts the system prompt, but it works fine. I hope [the system prompt gets fixed upstream](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/1000) anyway.

## Project-specific CLAUDE.md

You can override global settings for a specific project by creating a `CLAUDE.md` and `CLAUDE.local.md` in the root of that project. The first is intended to be committed and the second is intended to be ignored.

I don't want to assume my teammates use a specific tool like Claude, so I never create project-specific `CLAUDE.md` files. I don't even want the word Claude to appear in `.gitignore` so instead I ignore the file with:

```console
echo CLAUDE.local.md >> .git/info/exclude
```

I hope a standard emerges. I would be willing to check in a file called `LLM.md`.

The contents of `CLAUDE.local.md` vary. It's a good place to share:

- What the build tool is, and which commands to run before committing.
- Libraries to use and APIs to prefer.
- Whether to use a `justfile` or the language-native build tool.
