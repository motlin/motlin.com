Utility commands I use with Claude Code for code maintenance and cleanup, particularly for handling the LLM's tendency to over-comment code.

This post is part of my [Claude Code setup series](/blog/claude-code-setup).

## Comments {#comments}

LLMs write obvious comments. Despite clear instructions not to [in the system prompt](https://github.com/langgptai/awesome-claude-prompts/blob/2be4e1085e8c026cd12ad67fdd2ce61c1c42b2d6/README.md?plain=1#L494) and in my [global configuration](/blog/claude-code-configuration#too-many-comments), Claude consistently adds comments like:

```typescript
// Calculate elapsed time
const elapsedTimeMs = Date.now() - startTime
```

I've come to accept that comments are crucial to how LLMs "think" and I cannot stop the LLM from writing them, at least in the first draft. Instead, I use these commands to clean them up after the fact.

### `/all-comments` - Global Comment Cleanup {#all-comments---global-comment-cleanup}

The `/all-comments` command asks the LLM to clean up redundant comments across the entire codebase. After Claude deletes all the comments, I run [`git absorb`](https://github.com/tummychow/git-absorb) and it's as if the comments never existed in git history.

### `/comments` - Local Comment Cleanup {#comments---local-comment-cleanup}

The `comments` prompt is identical to `all-comments` except it adds the sentence "Look at the local code changes that are not yet committed to git" turning it into a local edit.

This is my preferred command because it integrates with [my workflow](/blog/claude-code-workflow-commands) and is perfect for cleaning up after `/todo`.

While I can't get the LLM to stop writing comments during initial implementation, these commands are extremely effective at cleaning them up after the fact.

## Emoji {#emoji}

This command adds emoji!

### Usage Patterns {#usage-patterns}

The `/emoji` command follows consistent patterns and avoids duplicates by using a two-pass approach to ensure variety and appropriateness.

## Learn {#learn}

When we solve tricky problems, this command helps document the solution for future reference.

### Knowledge Persistence {#knowledge-persistence}

The `/learn` command documents solutions in `CLAUDE.local.md` so the knowledge persists for future sessions, especially useful for CLI commands that required multiple attempts or specific ordering requirements.

## Rebase {#rebase}

This command systematically resolves merge conflicts during git rebases.

  {RebaseCommandSource}
</CodeBlock>

### Conflict Resolution Strategy {#conflict-resolution-strategy}

The `/rebase` command follows a structured approach to understand and fix each conflict, ensuring the rebase completes successfully without missing any issues.

## Next Steps {#next-steps}

These utility commands complement the main [development workflow](/blog/claude-code-workflow-commands) and work best with proper [Claude Code configuration](/blog/claude-code-configuration).
