I spent a lot of time writing and tweaking my prompts, so I'm sharing what works for me.

This is my complete Claude Code setup, broken down into four posts:

**üìã [Claude Code: Configuration That Works](/blog/claude-code-configuration)**

- Global `CLAUDE.md`
- Code style, commit message, and conversation guidelines

**üîÑ [Claude Code: The Perfect Development Loop](/blog/claude-code-workflow-commands)**

My core development loop using custom commands:
- `/todo` - Implement a task from a checklist
- `/commit` - `git commit` with a nice message
- `/compact` - Manage the context window

**üå≥ [Claude Code: Parallel Development with /worktree](/blog/claude-code-worktree)**

Work on multiple tasks in parallel:
- `/worktree` - Create Git worktrees for tasks
- Automatic task status tracking
- Clean context switching

**üõ†Ô∏è [Claude Code: Custom Slash Commands](/blog/claude-code-utility-commands)**

Commands for code maintenance:
- `/comments` - Clean up comments in recent changes
- `/all-comments` - Clean up comments project-wide
- `/emoji` - Add emoji to content
- `/learn` - Add to Claude memory
- `/rebase` - Resolve merge conflicts

**üì± [Claude Code: Getting Phone Notifications When Tasks Complete](/blog/claude-code-phone-notifications)**

Get notified when long-running tasks complete:
- Hooks configuration for task completion
- Push notifications via Pushover
- Text-to-speech announcements
- Works great with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
