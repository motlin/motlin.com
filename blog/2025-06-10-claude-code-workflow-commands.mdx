I've written two slash commands for Claude Code that form the core of my development workflow: `/todo` implements one task and `/commit` commits it.

<!-- truncate -->

This post is part of my [Claude Code setup series](/blog/claude-code-setup).

## Understanding Slash Commands

Claude Code comes with built-in slash commands like `/pr-comments`, which are essentially [shortcuts for specific prompts](https://gist.github.com/transitive-bullshit/487c9cb52c75a9701d312334ed53b20c#file-claude-code-prompts-js-L591-L597). You can also [create custom slash commands](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/tutorials#create-custom-slash-commands).

- **Global commands**: Place them in `$HOME/.claude/commands/example.md`
- **Project commands**: Place them in `./.claude/commands/example.md`

Both are invoked with `/example`. If a command exists in both locations, the project-specific version takes precedence.

You can find more examples and command definitions in the [claude-code-prompts repository](https://github.com/motlin/claude-code-prompts/tree/main/commands).

## The Development Loop

When building larger features, I work through a task list in `.llm/todo.md`:

1. Run `/todo` to implement the next task
2. Test and debug manually
3. Run `/commit` to commit the changes
4. Run `/compact` to clean up the conversation history
5. Repeat

## Creating the Task List

When planning larger changes, I tend to chat with a thinking model in the browser. At the end, I ask for a task list:

> Write a task list that we can work through to implement this idea, as a markdown checklist.
>
> Each checkbox should represent a task that we can implement and commit on its own.
>
> Arrange the tasks in the order we need to implement them, not in order of importance.
>
> Example format:
>
> - [ ] Add a test case for feature ABC.
>   - It's ok for the test to be failing at this point.
> - [ ] Implement feature ABC.
> - [ ] Delete DEF
>   - Replace usages of DEF with ABC.

I save this list to `.llm/todo.md`. I've [configured Claude](/blog/claude-code-configuration#extra-context-just-for-you) to ignore the `.llm` directory in version control.

## `/todo`

This command tells Claude to implement one task from the list.

<CodeBlock language="markdown" title=".claude-prompts/commands/todo.md">
  {TodoCommandSource}
</CodeBlock>

"Think hard" is [a magic word](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/19/claude-code-best-practices/) that triggers extended reasoning.

## `/commit`

After implementing and testing a task, I use `/commit` to create a commit:

<CodeBlock language="markdown" title=".claude-prompts/commands/commit.md">
  {CommitCommandSource}
</CodeBlock>

You don't need a custom command to commit - and Claude will offer to commit without being asked. But this gives me control over timing while leveraging Claude's ability to write good summaries.

## Managing the Context Window with `/compact`

The `/compact` command is built in but [not well documented](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/costs#reduce-token-usage). It's built on [a markdown prompt](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1jr52qj/here_is_claude_codes_compact_prompt/) to summarize the conversation, then replaces Claude's context with that summary.

After completing a task, I need to make room in the context window for the next task. I used to run `/compact` if the next task was related, and `/clear` if unrelated. Now I just always run `/compact`.

This is also a good time to restart with `claude --continue` if it has been running too long or if there's a new version available.

## Summary

This workflow breaks large features into manageable steps.

These commands work best when combined with proper [Claude Code configuration](/blog/claude-code-configuration).
