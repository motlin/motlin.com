Building on [my workflow with /todo and /commit](/blog/claude-code-workflow-commands), I've created the `/worktree` command to enable parallel development on multiple tasks using Git worktrees.

<!-- truncate -->

This post is part of my [Claude Code setup series](/blog/claude-code-setup).

## Evolution of My Workflow

I started with a simple pattern: maintain a todo list and repeatedly run [three commands](/blog/claude-code-workflow-commands):
- `/todo` - Implement one task
- `/commit` - Create a commit
- `/compact` - Manage the context window

This workflow steadily churned through my todo list, but LLMs can be slow. While waiting for one task to complete, I'd switch to working on a second task. Initially, I tried running Claude on two tasks in the same directory simultaneously, but they would trample each other's changes.

I started using [Git worktrees](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree). It worked well. Each instance of Claude works in its own directory, eliminating conflicts, while still working on a single git repository. Later, [Anthropic officially recommended using worktrees](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/common-workflows#run-parallel-claude-code-sessions-with-git-worktrees) in their documentation, which validated the approach.

## Building the /worktree Command

While Anthropic recommends using worktrees, they don't provide any automation or commands for managing them yet. I found myself spending too much time creating worktrees, copying todo lists, and managing branches myself. That's where my `/worktree` command comes in.

## Using the command

This command can be used within claude, with a number of worktrees to create.

```
/worktree 3

⏺ 1 worktree has been created so far.
⏺ 2 worktrees have been created so far.
⏺ 3 worktrees have been created.
```

Even though the worktrees used for parallel work, they are created in serial. Each time a worktree is created, Claude also opens a new iTerm tab, and kicks off the command:

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions /todo
```

## How It Works

The `/worktree` command automates several key steps:

### 1. Find and mark the next available todo
```markdown
- [ ] Implement user authentication with JWT
```
becomes:
```markdown
- [>] Implement user authentication with JWT <!-- worktree: implement-user-auth-jwt -->
```

### 2. Create the worktree
```bash
git worktree add ../my-app-implement-user-auth-jwt -b task/implement-user-auth-jwt HEAD
```

### 3. Set up the worktree environment
```bash
# Copy environment files if they exist
cp .envrc ../my-app-implement-user-auth-jwt/
direnv allow ../my-app-implement-user-auth-jwt

# Trust the directory for mise
mise trust ../my-app-implement-user-auth-jwt
```

### 4. Create a focused todo file
```bash
mkdir ../my-app-implement-user-auth-jwt/.llm
echo "- [ ] Implement user authentication with JWT" > .llm/todo.md
```

### 5. Launch Claude in a new terminal tab

Launch a new iTerm tab and run:

```bash
cd ../my-app-implement-user-auth-jwt
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions /todo
```

And if we wrote `/worktree 3`, the command will repeat these steps until 3 worktrees are created.

## Integration with /todo Workflow

The `/worktree` command creates a new worktree with its own `.llm/todo.md` file containing just the single task. This means you can use the [same /todo workflow](/blog/claude-code-workflow-commands) we've already established, but now with better isolation and the ability to work on multiple tasks in parallel. Each worktree starts fresh from main, giving you a clean context for every task.

## Managing Context Size

If we have a large number of tasks we want to run in parallel, we need to be careful about the context size. There are two ways I manage this.

A command like `/worktree 10` can run out of context in a single Claude session, trigger auto-compaction, and get lost. To avoid this, I move the looping outside of Claude.

```bash
for i in $(seq 1 10); do claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --print /worktree; done
```

The second problem is that if we run too many tasks in parallel, we can quickly hit API usage limits. To avoid this, I sometimes downgrade the model. At the time of writing, that means switching from Opus 4 to Sonnet 4.

If I'm going step away for a while, I can also use the `sleep` command to space out the requests. This allows me to run tasks overnight without hitting API limits.

```bash
for i in $(seq 1 11); do claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --print /worktree; sleep 1200; done
  ```

## Finishing Up

After all parallel tasks complete, I cherry-pick the completed work into a single branch. This gives me a chance to review all the changes together and ensure they work well as a cohesive whole.

If there are any merge conflicts, and they look at all tricky to resolve, I just throw away the work and mark the todo as `[ ]` again.

Finally, I clean up all worktrees except the current one.

```bash
git worktree remove ../myproject-add-user-auth-jwt
git branch -d task/add-user-auth-jwt
```

Or I ask Claude to do it for me. If you ask Claude to clean up worktrees, make sure to tell it not to use `--force`.
