# Sick Picks

## What are Sick Picks?

Inspired by the [Syntax.fm podcast](https://syntax.fm/sickpicks), Sick Picks are recommendations for anything, not necessarily related to technology. The hosts of Syntax end each episode by sharing their picks.

## üéß Overcast - Podcast Player

<img src="/img/sick-picks/overcast.png" alt="Overcast logo" style={{width: '180px', float: 'right', margin: '0 0 1rem 1rem'}} />

[Overcast](https://overcast.fm) is my podcast player of choice. It focuses on the audio and listening experience above all else.

What makes Overcast special is **Smart Speed** - it dynamically shortens silences in podcasts without affecting the natural cadence of speech. With other audio players I can listen at 1.3x to 1.5x, with Overcast I can comfortably listen to the same content at 1.6x to 1.8x.

Overcast is refreshingly focused on being the best listening experience possible. No social features or unnecessary complexity - just a beautifully designed app that prioritizes audio quality and playback control. Every feature is designed to enhance how you listen to podcasts, not distract from it.

Fun fact: [Syntax.fm has also featured Overcast as a sick pick](https://syntax.fm/show/081/hasty-treat-how-we-record-edit-and-host-our-podcast), recognizing it as one of the best podcast apps available.

## üî¶ Wurkkos TS10 & HD10 - EDC Flashlights

  <img src="/img/sick-picks/hd10-orange.jpg" alt="HD10 Orange" style={{width: '100px', margin: '0 5px'}} />
</div>

The Wurkkos TS10 and HD10 are enthusiast-grade everyday carry (EDC) flashlights that punch way above their weight class.

Why they're exceptional:
- **Anduril 2 firmware**: Open-source firmware with incredible customization options
- **Auxiliary LEDs**: Configurable RGB LEDs for battery indication or locating in the dark
- **14500 Li-ion battery**: TS10 uses replaceable batteries, HD10 has built-in USB-C charging
- **Right-angle design (HD10)**: The HD10's 90-degree head makes it perfect for hands-free use as a headlamp or work light, while also making room for USB-C charging, repositioning the button for easier access, and incorporating a magnetic tailcap for versatile mounting
- **Compact size**: Smaller than your thumb but outputs up to 1400 lumens
- **Enthusiast features**: Ramping brightness, candle mode, lightning storm mode, and more

I love the orange color aluminum options - they're bright, fun, and easy to spot in a bag. For those who want something more premium, the fancy metals like titanium and copper are gorgeous and develop unique patinas over time.

Color temperature is crucial for a pleasant light. I prefer the 4000K option which provides a warm, natural light that's easy on the eyes. Even better is the 3000K temperature (only available with the copper version) which gives an incredibly warm, candle-like glow that's perfect for evening use.

**Available Options:**
- [TS10 V2 in Orange (4000K)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DXFGN5JG/)
- [TS10 V2 in Titanium (4000K)](https://www.amazon.com/Wurkkos-TS10-Pocket-Flashlight-Rechargeable/dp/B0CMZJDX2V/)
- [TS10 V2 in Copper (3000K)](https://wurkkos.com/products/wurkkos-ts10-v2-copper) - The warmest, most candle-like option
- [HD10 in Orange (4000K)](https://www.amazon.com/Wurkkos-Flashlight-Rechargeable-Lumens-Magnet/dp/B0F673BFYH/) - With USB-C charging and magnetic tailcap

These flashlights have ruined all other flashlights for me. Once you experience the power and flexibility of a proper enthusiast light, there's no going back.

<img src="/img/sick-picks/olight-oclip-pro.jpg" alt="Olight Oclip Pro" style={{width: '180px', float: 'right', margin: '0 0 1rem 1rem'}} />

The [Olight Oclip Pro in Orange](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DDC3M31M/) is the perfect hands-free lighting solution that clips directly to your backpack strap.

What makes it great:
- **Versatile clip design**: Securely attaches to backpack straps, belts, or pockets

## üõπ Onewheel GT - Electric Board

<img src="/img/sick-picks/onewheel-gt-yellow.jpg" alt="Onewheel GT with highlighter yellow accessories" style={{width: '200px', float: 'right', margin: '0 0 1rem 1rem'}} />

After falling in love with my Pint, upgrading to the [Onewheel GT](https://onewheel.com/products/onewheel-gt) was inevitable. Mine is decked out with the highlighter yellow accessories from the launch event - impossible to miss and looks incredible.

Why the GT is exceptional:
- **Powerful performance**: The increased power helps go up inclines with confidence. I can even stand on it together with a kid and it handles the extra weight without breaking a sweat
- **20 MPH top speed**: The sweet spot for speed - fast enough to be thrilling, but not overwhelming. The 14 MPH limit on the old Pint just wasn't enough
- **Adult-sized footpads**: Finally, a board big enough for adult feet to not hang over the edges
- **Sensitive footpad**: The footpad is so responsive that even children can easily activate it, making it better for kids despite the board's hefty weight
- **No ghosting issues**: I never replaced the recalled front footpad (which was too sensitive and caused ghosting) - the current sensitivity is perfect
